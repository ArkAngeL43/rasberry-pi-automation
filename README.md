# rasberry-pi-automation
automation script for rasbian OS

so, i created this script yet again for personal use, there is ALOT of code in seperate files for this project, im going to make a wearable computer, my plan is to take a rasbian-OS system and strap it on a workouit armband along with a good set of fibers, now 


you may be askign where the f does this script come in at?


well this script is built around my personal use and my personal scripts ofc public now

ive been writing this idea for about a month and have been writing the scripts ever since 2019 for example toxic.py and everyhting else inside was an idea long before releases, and i wanted to make a bot i could call anytime, anywhere, at any point if i have the OS and SYS on me and it is turned on, i also wanted to make it valuable to hackers, and or penetration testers on the go, this is a perfect script for that combining all of my scripts, and my massive 5550 line framework developed for hacking, i hope some people find a sue for it but i definitly will
